# lint

The workflow check every forge repository runs the same way:
[actionlint](https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint) and
[zizmor](https://docs.zizmor.sh/) from images pinned by digest in
[Containerfile.pin](Containerfile.pin), then a runner-label
policy that denies `ubuntu-latest` in any `runs-on`. New workflows use
`ubuntu-26.04`; every other label, self-hosted and custom runners
included, is allowed.

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-26.04
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@3d3c42e5aac5ba805825da76410c181273ba90b1 # v7.0.1
        with:
          persist-credentials: false
      - uses: cgwalters-forge/actions/lint@main
```

It checks the repository checked out at the workspace root and needs
docker and cargo on the runner, as GitHub's Ubuntu runners have. zizmor
reads the repository's own `.github/zizmor.yml`, and runs its online
audits with the job's token (`contents: read` is enough): a hash pin to a
commit that exists only in a fork of the action's repository, or whose
`# vX` comment no longer matches it, fails the check.

## Runner labels

`ubuntu-latest` follows GitHub's choice of Ubuntu, so a workflow changes
under a repository without a commit. A job is refused when its `runs-on`
names a denied label: as a string, in a list or `labels`, as a quoted
literal inside an expression (`inputs.runner || 'ubuntu-latest'`), in the
job's matrix under any key when `runs-on` reads the matrix (`exclude`
aside), as the
default or a choice option of a `workflow_call` or `workflow_dispatch`
input that `runs-on` reads, or in the `with` of a job calling a reusable
workflow (followed through the matrix and inputs the same way). When any
of these reads `needs.JOB`, every string of that job's `outputs`, `env`
and steps' `run`, `with` and `env` counts too, one level deep, so a
dynamic matrix written to `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` is followed; a mention of a
denied label in that job's scripts for another purpose is refused as
well. Labels are compared case-insensitively, and `.YML` files are
checked as workflows-check takes them. It catches a label written by
mistake, not one assembled to get past it (`format()`, a repository
variable, a `needs` chain more than one job long).

The `deny` input adds labels to the list, separated by whitespace or
commas; `ubuntu-latest` stays on it whatever the input says.

## Locally

`just test-lint` also runs `tests/wrappers.rs`: its structural
contracts include tailnet broker defaults, broker-only review, artifact-only
research's no-publication wiring and checked-submit provenance. The research
outputs are checked by YAML key, so swapping two output names cannot pass.
These are static wiring checks, not live broker or publication tests. The
JavaScript execution tests (including research hand-back and submit preflight)
and Renovate's JavaScript-regex tests remain in the Node suite, alongside
review-policy assertions.

`just test-lint` includes the Rust register-preflight harness in
`tests/register_preflight.rs`. It needs Python 3.11+ (`tomllib`) to execute
both wrappers' actual Python steps against temporary configuration files,
checking credential ordering, child-agent refusal, malformed/missing input,
the 1-MiB boundary and unchanged file contents. It acquires no credentials
and makes no network calls. The target job's JavaScript and its Node tests
remain separate until the production helper delivery is available.

The wrapper and Tailscale action's RHEL prerequisite tests share a Rust
harness in `tests/wrappers.rs`, run by `just test-lint` in CI. It executes
the actual Bash steps with fixture OS releases and a recording sudo double,
checking exact ordered arguments without installing packages or making
system links. This replaces `tailscale/prerequisites.test.mjs`; the action's
runtime JavaScript remains unchanged.

The same suite replaces `tailscale/hardening.test.mjs`, executing the action's
actual hardening shell with a Python sudo recorder (no root or network needed).
It checks always-run wiring after the join, exact ordered arguments for both
join outcomes, absent CLI/socket directories and failure of either chmod.
This tests shell control flow, not kernel permissions or a live tailnet join;
the runtime JavaScript tests remain in the Node suite.

```sh
just --justfile path/to/actions/lint/Justfile --working-directory . check
```

`CONTAINER=podman` runs the linters with podman. Without `GH_TOKEN`
(`GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)`), zizmor runs offline and says so.

This repository's immutable wrapper self-pins use `# from main`: prose,
not an assertion that the reviewed commit is still the branch tip. Keep
that marker when updating the SHA; the scoped Renovate manager tracks
`main` separately. No audit exception is needed, and third-party version
comments and impostor-commit checks remain active.

With `GH_TOKEN` and zizmor 1.32.0 (the version in `Containerfile.pin`)
installed, run the opt-in online regression:
`just --justfile lint/Justfile test-online-self-pins`.
`ZIZMOR` may name its executable. It audits all seven wrapper self-pins,
then proves that reverting to `# main` fails against the advanced branch
and a wrong third-party version comment still fails. Ordinary
`just test-lint` stays offline; `just lint` runs the repository's online
audits when `GH_TOKEN` is set.

## workflows-check

The same crate builds the check an organization ruleset requires of every
pull request, so that a pull request cannot replace its own checker; see
[workflows-check.md](workflows-check.md).
